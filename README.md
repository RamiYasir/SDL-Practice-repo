# SDL-Practice-repo
A little bit of practice using the SDL library for C++

### Where is this going?
The project is a simple one which will eventually draw randomly coloured and sized circles to the SDL window. These circles will appear, move either up or down, and then dissappear.

### Where are you now?
As of 19.06.21, the branch MoreCirclesMoreColours makes 15 randomly-sized circles appear in random colours at random positions on the window. 

### Why, tho?
To practice SDL, improve my C++ and get to grips with github. Also, I think it'll look cool.
